# Ani-Watch List
I need help managing what Animes I am watching and wanted to track my watch history as well as work on a cool little project. This is my solution to that, currently I can only search through an AniList REST API.

*Todo*
- Create user profile + auth (auth0?)
- Add backend (NestJS) for saving anime data to user profile
- Create React route for user homepage with anime watch details 
- Integrate Plex API for automatic watch updating(?) 
- *Get better at using typescript* 

*Done*
- Create search component that will list anime
- Find REST API for anime data [AniAPI](https://aniapi.com/)
